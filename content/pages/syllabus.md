## Course Description and Objectives

This course will engage with the theory and practice of planning and public policy, in the context of the U.S. political economy and changing national and global policy priorities and frameworks. These changes are driven in part by passage of historic legislation in the past year and will lead to unprecedented U.S. federal funding as well as private sector investment that will flow to cities and states over the next ten years to fund physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and clean energy. 

The course will review challenges to the dominant policy paradigms of the past several decades, including neoliberalism, globalization, and industrial strategy in the context of race, equity, sustainability, technology, and innovation, among other topics. Students will be assigned readings that cover classic literature and case studies on these topics, will engage in discussions around relevant themes, and will have a chance to hear from guest speakers throughout the semester. Students will be partnered with states/cities that are grappling with some of these questions, and will support them in developing a strategy for spending or accessing funding. Funds permitting, they will have the opportunity to travel to the site for field visits with the city or state office. 

The class will examine policies and funding in the broader context of changing paradigms and frameworks, while also delving into the weeds of policymaking by engaging with policymakers/others at the city and state level to understand how they are responding to this unique moment. Students will learn about the profound shifts that are occurring in U.S. public policy at both the local and national level as well as about policymaking at these two different levels of government. The objective of the course is to offer a grounding in the why and how of the priorities driving today’s policies, the inputs and processes that go into developing policies, and the downstream implications for federal policy decisions on cities and states. 

## Course Requirements
