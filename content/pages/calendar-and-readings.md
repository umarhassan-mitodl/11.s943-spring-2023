## Course Plan

The following lists the topic of each class session and provides the core readings assigned for the class as well as a supplemental reading list. Classes before spring break will be focused on paradigms and frameworks that shape U.S. policymaking. After spring break, we will turn to specific policy topics. The first publications listed under each class topic speak to more theory and foundations (chapters will be assigned from these readings); subsequent publications speak to policies / case studies and applications.
